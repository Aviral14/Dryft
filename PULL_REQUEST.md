# Pull Request Guidelines

## Make sure you have read [the contribution guide](CONTRIBUTION.md) first.

1. Prefix your PR with `[FIX]:`, `[DOC]:`, `[FEAT]:` or whatever is suitable.
    - PR can be prefixed with multiple topics if it deals with multiple topics.
    - PRs should only do one thing at a time. Make separate PRs for separate things.
2. Write a short, useful heading. Explain the PR in the details.
3. End the details with `Close #<ISSUE_NO>` where ISSUE_NO is the number of the issue that this PR closes.
