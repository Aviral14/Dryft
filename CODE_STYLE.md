# Coding Style

1. Follow [camel case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) for variable and method names.
2. Follow pascal case (camel case with first letter capitalised) for class names.
3. Give short, meaningful names.
4. Indent code with 4 spaces.
5. Give spaces around binary operators.
6. Give space between `if`, `while`, `for` etc and their condition parenthesis.
7. Braces start from same line as declaration, end in a new line.
